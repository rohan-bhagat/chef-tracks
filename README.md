This cookbook is tested only on ubuntu 14.04 LTS server

* Put the track directory under your location of cookbooks.
* Tested locally so far using `sudo chef-client -z -o tracks`

** It is not my intention to damage any system. Though this goes without saying, I am not responsible for any damage done on your systems.**
